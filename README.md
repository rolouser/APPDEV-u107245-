# SUMMARY


The geographical location of Colombia, the geomorphological conditions and
terrain, together with the abundant water supply, make the country a suitable territory
to carry out multicriteria studies and varied analysis, for decision making
in short, medium and long environmental and anthropomorphic impact projects
term.
Due to technological advances in both licensed software of different costs
such as Arcgis and also free and open source code software for
install from the internet, the scans mentioned above can be
modeled, embodied dynamically in a wide range of them.
As professionals in geomatics, with the theoretical and practical criteria, the
need to apply comparison methodologies that meet criteria
normative and technical, specifying the way to treat spatial information,
taking into account how to obtain the software, installation and management, in order to give a
their concept depending on the scenario of the projects to be worked on and the
purpose for which one of the programs was obtained. To make the comparison
applied to the result of the hydrographic analysis of basins obtained with the two
software, was implemented for an area of ​​the municipality of Porcesito in the department
of Antioquia, supported with data from the area such as digital models
elevation and base mapping.
